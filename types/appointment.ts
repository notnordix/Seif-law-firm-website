// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' without declaration or import.
// A common use case for these variables is within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment suggesting the inclusion of a testing framework import.
// If the variables are intended for a different purpose, the appropriate declarations or imports should be added accordingly.

// Example: If using Jest, you might need to import these functions.
// import { it, is, and, correct, brevity } from '@jest/globals';

// Or, if these are custom variables, they need to be declared:
// const it = () => {};
// const is = () => {};
// const and = () => {};
// const correct = () => {};
// const brevity = () => {};

// Without the original code, I can only provide this general guidance.
// Please replace this comment block with the actual code from types/appointment.ts
// and then add the necessary imports or declarations based on the context of the code.
